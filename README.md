The site effortlessly computes exponent results. Input your base and exponent value and the math will math itself.

This application uses: Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway and DynamoDB.

*Amplify Hosts the Webpage
*API Gateway Invokes the Lambda math function
*Lambda configures the math
*Dynamo DB stores/return the math results
*IAM sets permissions on the execution role for Lambda

I edited the site appearance by using code from ChatGPT to give it a more neutral look.
